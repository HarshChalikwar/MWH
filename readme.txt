Features
Web Scraping: The application uses web scraping to extract content from websites. It can scrape and analyze entire websites to gather information.

Conversational Style: The answer generation process is designed to provide responses in a conversational and human-like manner, making it user-friendly and engaging.

Langchain Integration: Langchain is used to manage and preprocess the text data before feeding it into the GPT-3.5 model. This ensures efficient and effective language processing.

GPT-3.5 Model: The heart of the application is the GPT-3.5 language model by OpenAI. It is responsible for understanding and generating responses to user queries.

Caching: To improve performance and reduce the load on the web servers, the application includes a caching mechanism to store and retrieve previously scraped data.
